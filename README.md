This commit covers Phase 0, Sessions 1 through 10, focused on building a computer engineering mindset from absolute zero.

Key concepts learned:
- Computers as deterministic instruction-executing machines
- CPU execution cycle: Fetch → Decode → Execute
- Relationship between CPU, RAM, storage, and motherboard
- Why RAM is mandatory for program execution
- Volatile nature of RAM and runtime memory behavior
- Memory addressing and how CPU interacts with memory
- Memory layout fundamentals: stack vs heap
- Stack structure, sensitivity, and role of return addresses
- How execution flow is controlled by memory
- Core idea of exploitation: hijacking CPU execution by manipulating memory

Objective:
Establish deep understanding of memory and execution as the foundation for
exploitation techniques, Red Team operations, and advanced hardware security.
